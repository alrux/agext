# ALRUX Go Extensions

An open-source [Go](http://golang.org) library aiming to save developer time and sanity. It contains productivity, convenience, and utility packages developed at ALRUX.

This repository acts as an index for the collection. Each available package is added as a submodule and has its own repository, linked from the title of the corresponding item in the list below.

## Package list (alphabetical)

### [calmly](https://github.com/agext/calmly)

For panic conditions that need to be handled by the program (rather than crashing it).

### [errors](https://github.com/agext/errors)

When you need to retain more information about an error message than a single string allows, just substitute this package for the one in the standard library.

### [levenshtein](https://github.com/agext/levenshtein)

Levenshtein distance and similarity metrics in Go (golang). Customizable edit costs and Winkler-like bonus for common prefix.

### [regexp](https://github.com/agext/regexp)

This package adds new methods to the `Regexp` type to allow for more efficient processing of submatches, while maintaining 100% backwards-compatibility with the standard package.

### [uuid](https://github.com/agext/uuid)

Generate, encode, and decode Universally Unique IDentifiers, version 1 (time-based), as defined in [RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt).
