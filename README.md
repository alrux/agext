# ALRUX Go Extensions

A collection of tweaks and additions to the standard [Go](http://golang.org) library. This repository acts as an index for the collection. Each available package is added as a submodule and has its own repository, linked from the title of the corresponding item in the list below.

## Package list (alphabetical)

### [errors](https://github.com/agext/errors)

If you need to retain more information about an error message than a single string allows, just substitute this package for the one in the standard library.

### [regexp](https://github.com/agext/regexp)

This package adds new methods to the `Regexp` type to allow for more efficient processing of submatches, while maintaining 100% backwards-compatibility with the standard package.

### [uuid](https://github.com/agext/uuid)

Generate, encode, and decode Universally Unique IDentifiers, version 1 (time-based), as defined in [RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt).
